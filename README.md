🌌 Rift Sky
Rift Sky is a minimalist, high-contrast weather Progressive Web App (PWA) built for the Rift Ecosystem. It strips away the clutter of traditional weather apps to focus on high-impact environmental data, specifically tuned for the Indian climate.

✨ Features
🌪️ Signature "Rain Start" Timer
Leveraging granular 15-minute precipitation probability data from Open-Meteo, Rift Sky provides a real-time countdown. If rain is detected within the hour, a high-visibility alert triggers: "Rain starting in 12 mins. Secure the perimeter."

🌫️ Indian Standard AQI & UV
Focuses on the metrics that matter. Get prominent, color-coded cards for Air Quality (AQI) and UV Index, critical for daily planning in high-exposure regions.

🟣 Monsoon-Adaptive UI
Built with a "Liquid Glass" design system, the entire app interface dynamically reacts to the environment. When humidity crosses 85%, the background gradient shifts into a deep Retro Iris (#A056FF) pulse, signaling a high-monsoon state.

📱 Android-Native Experience (PWA)
Standalone Mode: Hides browser UI for a true app-like feel.

Offline Caching: View the last fetched weather data instantly, even without a connection.

Maskable Icons: Perfectly circular launcher icons that fit the Android Material You aesthetic.
